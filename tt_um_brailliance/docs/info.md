## How it works

Input ASCII signals to 8-bit braille outputs (First two bits are zeroed for redundancy)

## How to test

Connect to FPGA and use breadboards + LEDs/Push Pull Solenoid Actuators for product demonstration

## External hardware

- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- LEDs / Push Pull Solenoid Actuators
- Resistors
