## How it works

The project is a 4-bit ALU section that is usfull in mini and micro computer CPUs.

## How to test

This device can be tested by inputting data on the two input ports (A/B), a function code (F0, F1, F2) and 
observing the output on pins d0, d1, d2, d3.

## External hardware

This project was tested uising an Altera FPGA (EP2C20F484C7).
