# Tiny Tapeout VGA Glyph Mode

![example VGA output](docs/screenshot.png)


This is an entry into the Tiny Tapeout Demoscene competition.  The name is a
play on the VGA Text Mode, but this project uses glyphs seen in
[The Matrix Digital Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SneR61OG4ZI) -- a
brilliant effect from the best science fiction movie since 1999.

The demo is targeting the following categories:

 - **Best single tile design** (~53% utiliation)
 - **Best graphics** (closely resembles movie effect)
 - **Most impressive for the size** (single tile features 48 unique glyphs, four color palettes)
 - **Most useful design** (connect multiple boards to recreate the Nebuchadnezzar operator monitor array!)

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)
