### Selecting the active project

Use uio[1:0] to select the active micro-tile project.

## Project 0 - Test

* Repo: https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-micro-tiles-experiment
* Author: Uri Shaked
* Description: Micro tiles test module

### How it works

The micro tiles test module is a simple module that demonstrates the use of the micro tile interface.

It has two modes of operation:

1. Mirroring the input pins to the output pins (when `rst_n` is low).
3. Outputing a counter on the output pins and the bidirectional pins (when `rst_n` is high).

The counter is an 8-bit counter that increments on every clock cycle, and resets when `rst_n` is low.

### How to test

1. Set `rst_n` low and observe that the input pins (`ui_in`) are output on the output pins (`uo_out`).
2. Set `rst_n` high and observe that the counter is output on the output pins (`uo_out`).

## Project 1 - Wokwi Doodle

* Repo: https://github.com/dlmiles/tt08-micro-wokwi-doodle (micro)
* Repo: https://github.com/dlmiles/tt08-wokwi-doodle (1x1)
* Wokwi: https://wokwi.com/projects/408272151035187201
* Module: tt_um_wokwi_408272151035187201
* Author: Darryl Miles
* Description: TT08 Wokwi Doodle

How to build instructions in README.md of tt08-micro-wokwi-doodle

Picture of circuit also in README.md

## How it works

I don't know how it works, it is a doodle.

The aim is to see if a random doodle can be made to count on the 7SEG.

Maybe it can, maybe it can't, let the truth tables work it out.

## How to test

Send all possible input combinations to the project and see what happens.

It has never been tested to find out if it is possible to observe a full set
of 7SEG font states at the output.

## External hardware

None, just the standard Tiny Tapeout PCB.

## Project 2 - NCO
* Repo: https://github.com/gfg-development/tt-micro-tiles-nco
* Author: Gerrit Grutzeck
* Description: Micro tiles nummerical controlled oscillator, which generates a PDM stream of a sawtooth

### How it works 
On `ui_in` the desired frequency is set. The hightest output frequency is the clock divided by $2^{21} / (2^8 - 1)$. The lowest possible frequency is the clock divided by $2^{21}$.
First a phase accumulator is used to generate the sawtooth. The resulting waveform is then converted into a PDM stream in a second stage.
This generated PDM datastream is output via `uo_out[7]`. 

### How to test
Connect the audio Pmod to the output ports or any other low pass filter with a speaker to `uo_out[7]`. 
Then configure the clock to a meaningfull frequency (e.g. 50 MHz for frequencies between 6 kHz and 24 Hz). 
Finally set the `ui_in` pins to the desired frequency (= clk / $2^{21}$ * `ui_in`). After applying the reset, the sawtooth will be generated.

## Project 3 - Micro Maze
* Repo: https://github.com/htfab/micro-maze
* Author: htfab
* Description: A simple fixed maze game with 7-segment output

## How it works

The player can walk around the maze, showing the adjacent walls on the 7-segment display.

## How to test

Use the first four inputs to move up, down, left or right.
