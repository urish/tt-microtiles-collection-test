# Tiny Tapeout nVious Retro FCX 890 Graphics

![example VGA output](docs/screenshot.png)

This is an entry into the Tiny Tapeout Demoscene competition.  This project
aims to add retro graphics to dozens of existing projects by intercepting the
binary output typically sent to the 7-segment LED display and redirecting it to
a VGA-compatible monitor.

The demo is targeting the following categories:

 - **Best single tile design** (~71% utilization)
 - **Best graphics** (Retrowave Fuchsia Extreme mode (FCX On))
 - **Most impressive for the size** (single tile features many color gradients, complex shapes, and 3D effect)
 - **Most useful design** (adds stylized output compatible with dozens of existing projects)
