## How it works

**adder_with_flow_control** design contains an adder with a separate flow
control for each argument and the result.

The design is an answer to an RTL job interview question described by Yuri
Panchul in an [article](https://habr.com/en/articles/706484/) (in Russian)
on Habr website. The design is used as a part of
[systemverilog-homework](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/systemverilog-homework)
and
[basics-graphics-music](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music)
GitHub repositories. These repos are maintained by engineers and educators
associated with the [Verilog Meetup](https://verilog-meetup.com/) community.

In this solution to the interview question, the flow control is implemented
using one of the following pipeline register/buffer modules. The choice is
specified inside the *adder_with_flow_control.sv* module using the define
macro *FLOW_CONTROL_BUFFER*.

* fcb_1_single_allows_back_to_back
* fcb_2_single_half_perf_no_comb_path
* fcb_3_single_for_pipes_with_global_stall
* fcb_4_wrapped_2_deep_fifo
* fcb_5_double_buffer_from_dally_harting

More details about the modules:

### fcb_1_single_allows_back_to_back

This module is a general-purpose flow-controlled register
which allows full back-to-back performance
but has a combinational path between down_rdy and up_rdy
which can introduce timing problems in deep pipelines.

### fcb_2_single_half_perf_no_comb_path

This flow-controlled register has no combinational path at all,
but cannot sustain a back-to-back stream of data.
However, it requires fewer gates than *fcb_4_wrapped_2_deep_fifo*
or *fcb_5_double_buffer_from_dally_harting*.

### fcb_3_single_for_pipes_with_global_stall

This flow-controlled register is suitable
if the designer wants to always
stall the whole pipeline at once,
without parts of it making progress.

### fcb_4_wrapped_2_deep_fifo

The most high-bandwidth flow-controlled buffer
among those that have no combinational path
between down_rdy and up_rdy.
However this solution occupies the largest area.

### fcb_5_double_buffer_from_dally_harting

This pipeline buffer is Yuri Panchul's edition of the code derived from 
*Digital Design: A Systems Approach by William James Dally and R. Curtis Harting. 2012*.
It has high bandwidth and no combinational path between down_rdy and up_rdy,
but not the highest possible bandwidth for this *adder_with_flow_control*
design.

## How to test

A self-checking testbench for the design is located in a directory
*test_extra* that contains:

* *clean.bash* - a script to delete temporary files produced by
  *simulate.bash*.

* *simulate.bash* - a script that simulates the design together with a testbench using
  Icarus Verilog and produces a log *log.txt*.

* *tb.sv* - a self-checking testbench that generates a log, a status
  **PASS** or **FAIL**, and performance data.

After the manufacturing, the design can be manually tested in the same way it
is tested in the testbench. It is important to cover the following
scenarios:

* Back-to-back data.
* Argument starvation (either *A* or *B*).
* Backpressure.
