## How it works

Generates VGA output for displaying pattern similar to [Ishihara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test) plates used for conducting a color blindness test. (Disclaimer: Note that this is not an approved medical test and test setup. The pattern generated is for purely experimental purpose.) 

## How to test

This project will work out of the box. Just connect a VGA display via [TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga).
