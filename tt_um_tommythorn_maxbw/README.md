# A simple asynchronous multiplier example

This design emits a sequence of `r` = x^2+x, for x=0,1,2,... on the
outputs using the handshake protocol (tie ack to req to get free
running sequence).  Well, in truth, we use 26-bits of internal
precision, but we only have 15-bits for outputs, we what is actually
emitted is `r ^ (r >> 15)`.

The very naive algorithm (with the body unrolled once) is

``` python
x = 0
loop:
  x = x + 1
  a = b = c = x
  while b != 0:
    if (b & 1) == 1:
      c += a
    a *= 2
    b /= 2
    if (b & 1) == 1:
      c += a
    a *= 2
    b /= 2
  output (c)
```

which was hand translated (roughly following [Introduction to
Asynchronous Circuit
Design](https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/215895041/JSPA_async_book_2020_PDF.pdf)
) into a token flow graph:

![token-flow graph](docs/graph.svg)

Note, I use a simpler, less expensive, construction for the
conditional iteration as having independent control-flow for the
trivial condition is overkill.

The graph was realized using four-phase bundled data.  Alas, I'm still
working on the timing analysis, so the inserted delays are (hopefully)
way oversized.

# Tiny Tapeout Verilog Project Template

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
