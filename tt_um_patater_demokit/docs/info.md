## How it works

This design outputs a waggling 6-bit rainbow demo on VGA.

The demo will change effect based on inputs on `ui_in`.

| Pin | Pin Name | Setting | Effect |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| `ui_in[0]` | `DUAL_EN` | Dual mode | Horizontally flips the image each scan line |
| `ui_in[1]` | `HWAVE_EN` | H wave | Enables use of horizontal waves |
| `ui_in[4:2]` | `P0_OFF_{2,1,0}` | P0 offset | Controls the speed of the H wave |
| `ui_in[7:5]` | `P1_OFF_{2,1,0}` | P1 offset | Controls the speed of the V wave |

## How to test

If wanting to test without hardware, use [the VGA
playground](https://tinytapeout.github.io/vga-playground/). Copy and paste the
contents of the entire `src/project.v` file into the playground's text editor,
replacing all previous content. Then, change the name of the module from
`tt_um_patater_demokit` to `tt_um_vga_example` and the simulator will start
running in your browser.

If testing with hardware, use a [TinyVGA
PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga). Clock the design with 25.175 MHz as
described in `info.yaml` (25.157 MHz is standard for 60 Hz 640x480 VGA video).

If testing with lower level simulation tools, an incomplete cocotb test bench
(`test/test.py`) is provided. Passing the tests in the cocotb bench is no
guarantee that the design will work.
